All the concepts taught so far in this bootcamp will be used to create Tic-Tac-Toe. By making this program, you will get experience with using what you know to create something tangible.

Goal:
Create a program that allows two people to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The program should keep track of how many games each person has won and each player will take turns starting the game.

Tasks:
To create Tic-Tac-Toe, there are many different steps that must be done. Below is a recommended order for implementing the program. Make sure each component works for sure before moving on to another one.

1. Draw the Tic-Tac-Toe board on the screen.
2. Create a Tic_Tac_Toe class to store a Tic-Tac-Toe board and any other data/methods that will be implemented later.
3. Allow the user to be able to put X's and O's on the screen (for now, X always goes first).
4. Make a method to clear all X's and O's off the board.
5. Prevent any moves from overwriting an already existing move.
6. Make a method that checks if the board is full.
7. Make a method that checks if either player has won a current game (Hint: also make a helper method that checks for any possible three-in-a-rows on the board).
8. Add variables to track the number of wins for each player and increment them when necessary.
9. Make the program alternate the starting player each game.
10. Add print statements to provide users info during the game (e.g. who's turn it is, who won the game or did it end as a tie, the scores of each player after every game).
